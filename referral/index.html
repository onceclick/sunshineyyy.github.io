    <p>I have this card for more than two years and I like it a lot. Points earned in this card are Chase Ulitimate Rewards Points. They are super valuable since you can redeem them for air travel for 20% off when booked from Chase webistes (normally the same price you found on other sites). You can also transfer to participating frequent travel programs like United MileagePlus, Hyatt Gold Passport, etc. For example, you can transfer the points 1:1 ratio to Hyatt points, which you can use to book Hyatt hotels and the points are values at least 1.5 cents/point. Essentially, the 55,000 points you get from openning the card are valued at least $825 if you consider booking hotel using Hyatt or $687.5 if you booking travel through Chase. $0 Introductory Annual Fee the first year, then $95 after the first year.

    <p>I have this card for more than three years and I like the rotating 5% quaterly catergery bonuses. Points earned in this card are Chase Ulitimate Rewards Points. You can transfer them to Chase Sapphire Preferred and it will become as valuable as described in the Chase Sapphire Preferred card section. Otherwise they have a face value of 1 cent/point, you can redeem them for cash easily. This card has no annual fee at all. It's a nice card as a starter to build your credit and keep for long term.</p>
