<h4>A novel switchable bistable switch in yeast</h4>
<p>The genetic bistable switch is a fundamental building block for engineering synthetic living systems. In synthetic biology, researchers have designed and constructed rudimentary bistable switches in <i>E. coli</i> and in mammalian cells. However, it remains challenging to construct a reusable, modular, switchable bistable switch in eukaryotes. In this project, I designed and built a novel switchable bistable switch in yeast, the model organism for eukaryotes. This switch can be switched on and off by adding two kinds of small molecules.</p>

<h4>A plant hormone induced oscillator in yeast</h4>
<p><img alt="oscillator_network" class="project-figure-right" src="/images/oscillator_network.png" />Biochemical oscillators are fundamental to understanding cell physiology, and present an ongoing challenge in building synthetic living systems. In synthetic biology, researchers have built a number of oscillators over the last decade resulting in various designs in organisms from E. coli to mammalian cells. However, especially in eukaryotic cells, a robust, tunable, and modular oscillator technology has yet to be demonstrated. In this project, I designed and analyzed a plant hormone induced oscillator in yeast. I developed mathematical model and showed that the oscillator could be achieved by tuning two key parameters. Currently I am working on experimental realizing this oscillator.</p>

<h4>The Aquarium cloning processes</h4>
<img alt="aquarium_ecoli" class="project-figure-right" src="/images/aquarium_ecoli.png" />
<p><a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html">Aquarium</a> is a smart wetlab operating system developed in the Klavins Lab where researchers can specify how to manipulate items that stored in the inventory using protocols and metacols (a chain of protocols) that written in computer codes. Adapted from the standard molecular cloning processes that were already been practiced in the Klavins Lab before Aquarium were largely used, I wrote a majority of the codes implementing two core molecular cloning processes (plasmid construction and yeast cloning) that take and batch users' inputs from tasks and semi-automatically schedule new tasks as needed, which result in two processes that is easier for researchers to use Aquarium to do cloning work.<p>

<h4>Frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast</h4>
<p><img alt="frequency" class="project-figure-right" src="/images/frequency.gif" />
<p>In the <a href="http://klavinslab.org/">Klavins Lab</a> and <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/nemlab/">Nemhauser Lab</a>, researchers have imported a auxin signaling pathway from plant to yeast. I did experiment to show how different frequencies of inputs applied to the pathway affect the output. The approach is using a microfluidic device called CellASIC to grow the yeast cell, where we can control the system precisely with different frequencies of inducers and observe using fluorescence microscopy over time. I developed Matlab scripts to do image processing on the resulted time course fluorescence images and get quantified time-course fluorescence data on the cells. Then a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot">Bode plot</a> depicting the frequency response of signaling pathway was generated.</p>
