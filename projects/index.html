<h4>A novel switchable bistable switch in yeast</h4>
<p>The genetic bistable switch is a fundamental building block for engineering synthetic living systems. In synthetic biology, researchers have designed and constructed rudimentary bistable switches in <i>E. coli</i> and in mammalian cells. However, it remains challenging to construct a reusable, modular, switchable bistable switch in eukaryotes. In this project, I designed and built a novel switchable bistable switch in yeast, the model organism for eukaryotes. This switch can be switched on and off by adding two kinds of small molecules.</p>

<h4>A plant hormone induced oscillator in yeast</h4>
<p><img alt="oscillator_network" class="project-figure-right" src="/images/oscillator_network.png" />Biochemical oscillators are fundamental to understanding cell physiology, and present an ongoing challenge in building synthetic living systems. In synthetic biology, researchers have built a number of oscillators over the last decade resulting in various designs in organisms from E. coli to mammalian cells. However, especially in eukaryotic cells, a robust, tunable, and modular oscillator technology has yet to be demonstrated. In this project, I designed and analyzed a plant hormone induced oscillator in yeast. I developed mathematical model and showed that the oscillator could be achieved by tuning two key parameters. Currently I am working on experimental realizing this oscillator.</p>

<h4>The Aquarium cloning workflows</h4>
<img alt="aquarium_ecoli" class="project-figure-right" src="/images/aquarium_ecoli.png" />
<p><a href="http://klavinslab.org/aquarium.html" target="_blank">Aquarium</a> is a smart laboratory operating system invented in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> where researchers can specify how to manipulate items that stored in the inventory using protocols and workflows written in computer codes. Adapted from the standard molecular cloning workflows, I wrote a majority of the codes in Ruby implementing two core molecular cloning workflows: plasmid construction and yeast cloning. These workflows take and batch users' inputs to the workflow and semi-automatically schedule the entire cloning process from ordering primers to Sanger sequencing verifications, resulting a nearly effortless cloning process in Aquarium.<p>

<h4>Frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast</h4>
<p><img alt="frequency" class="project-figure-right" src="/images/frequency.gif" /></p>
<p>I developed an experimental process in the <a href="http://klavinslab.org" target="_blank">Klavins Lab</a> to interrogate frequency response for a synthetic auxin signaling pathway in yeast. The approach was using a microfluidic device called <a href="http://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/life-science-research/cell-culture-systems/cellASIC-live-cell-analysis/microfluidic-plates/68eb.qB.wfkAAAFBWmVb3.sJ,nav" target="_blank">CellASIC</a> to grow the yeast cell, where one can control the system precisely with different frequencies of auxin inputs and observe using fluorescence microscopy over time. I wrote Matlab based software to do image processing on the time course fluorescence images, which resulted in quantified time-course fluorescence data on the cells. Using the data, I generated a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot" target="_blank">Bode plot</a> describing the frequency response of signaling pathway. The result showed that this pathway works as a low-pass filter.</p>

  <h4>CatchOneBus: Personalizable real time bus checking app on Pebble smart watch</h4>
  <a href="/CatchOneBus"><img alt="catchonebus" class="project-figure-right-higher" src="/images/catchonebus_web.png" /></a>
  <p>CatchOneBus is a hobby software project I started when got a Pebble Steel. CatchOneBus is a personalizable real time bus checking app works on any Pebble watch currenlty supporting Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, Boston, Tampa and New York City. Opening up <a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/55331752ac075102f30000a7">CatchOneBus</a> on your watch will show nearby bus stops and real time routes information on your Pebble Smartwatch. You can save any stops as favorite and CatchOneBus will show your favorite bus stop real time info at the first page of the app when you are near that stop. Essentially, this makes checking your commuter bus real time personalizable and fast. Check out this <a href="/CatchOneBus">page</a> to learn more.
